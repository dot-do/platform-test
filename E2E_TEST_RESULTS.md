# E2E Autonomous Workflow Test Results

## Test Run: Issue #13
**Date**: 2025-11-03
**Test Type**: Full autonomous workflow validation
**Issue**: [#13](https://github.com/dot-do/platform-test/issues/13)

## Deployed Fixes Being Tested

1. ✅ **RPC events worker integration** - No more fetch errors
2. ✅ **Absolute URLs for state machine routing** - No more Invalid URL errors

## Workflow Steps

| Step | Description | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Issue assignment triggers webhooks worker | ✅ PASS | Successfully triggered |
| 2 | Webhooks routes to Implementation state machine | ✅ PASS | Routed via https://state.do/machines/implementation |
| 3 | State machine creates claude-code session | ✅ PASS | Session created for tomdolen |
| 4 | Claude-code implements solution and creates PR | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | This step |
| 5 | PR triggers Review state machine | ⏳ PENDING | Will trigger on PR creation |
| 6 | Quinn-qa reviews and approves | ⏳ PENDING | Will occur after PR creation |

## Implementation Details

### Deployed Versions
- **webhooks2**: `15768118-d5ff-4806-ae5b-bb20b9f5d57d`
- **events RPC**: Working via `env.events.send()`

### Test Execution
- **Branch**: `claude/issue-13-20251103-1107`
- **Workflow Run**: [#19032420579](https://github.com/dot-do/platform-test/actions/runs/19032420579)
- **Agent**: tomdolen (Claude Code)

## Observations

### ✅ Successful Components
1. Issue assignment properly triggered the webhooks worker
2. No fetch errors encountered (RPC integration working)
3. No Invalid URL errors (absolute URLs working correctly)
4. State machine successfully created Claude Code session
5. Claude Code agent successfully analyzed issue and began implementation

### Test Artifacts
- This documentation file serves as evidence of successful execution through step 4
- PR creation will validate the complete workflow chain
- Review state machine trigger will be validated upon PR creation

## Next Steps

1. Create PR to trigger Review state machine (step 5)
2. Validate that Quinn-qa review is triggered automatically (step 6)
3. Record final test results

## Conclusion

**Status**: E2E workflow test proceeding as expected. All deployed fixes are functioning correctly through step 4 of 6.
